@@ Chargen Data Object
@@   Aspect Descs: For each of the aspects, there should be a description of what that aspect entails. High concept and trouble are 1 and 2 by default; the aspects defined in &aspects-other on Chargen Config are listed by number after that.
@@   Skills: Self-explanatory, I hope. List all skills here. Information about specific skills is stored in other attributes.
@@   Stunts: You may notice that the name is listed twice. This is intentional. The name in the description is the text that gets displayed on the sheet, in case of stunt names with special characters or acronyms in stunt names. The system will match against both when given a request to do something with a stunt.
&aspect-1.desc Chargen Data=Your high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about - who he is and what he does. It's an aspect, one of the first and most important ones for your character.%r%rThink of this aspect like your job, your role in life, or your calling - it's what you're good at, but it's also a duty you have to deal with, and it's constantly filled with problems of its own. That is to say, it comes with some good and some bad. There are a few different directions you can take this:%r%r * You could take the idea of "like your job" literally: %xhLead Detective%xn, %xhKnight of the Round%xn, %xhLow-level Thug%xn.%r%r * You could throw on an adjective or other descriptor to further define the idea: %xhDespicable Regent of Riverton%xn, %xhReluctant Lead Detective%xn, %xhAmbitious Low-level Thug%xn.%r%r * You could mash two jobs or roles together that most people would find odd: %xhWizard Private Eye%xn, %xhSinging Knight of the Round Table%xn, %xhMonster-slaying Accountant%xn.%r%r * You could play off of an important relationship to your family or an organization you're deeply involved with (especially if the family or organization are well-connected or well-known): %xhBlack Sheep of the Thompson Family%xn, %xhLow-level Thug for the Syndicate%xn, %xhScar Triad's Patsy in Riverton%xn.%r%rThese aren't the only ways to play with your high concept, but they'll get you started. But don't stress out over it - the worst thing you can do is make it into too big of a deal. You'll come up with four other aspects after this one - you don't have to get it all nailed right now.%r%rHigh concepts can have overlap among the characters, as long as you have something to distinguish how your character is different from the others.
&aspect-2.desc Chargen Data=
&aspect-3.desc Chargen Data=The first phase is your character's first true adventure - his first book, episode, case, movie, whatever - starring him.%r%rThen, you need to think up and write down the basic details of this story for the phase's summary. The story doesn't need to have a lot of detail—in fact, a pair of sentences works pretty well—because your fellow players will add in their own details to this past adventure in the next two phases (as you will to theirs).%r%rIf you find yourself stuck, look to your character's high concept and trouble. Find a dilemma that has a chance of throwing those ideas into focus. What problem do you get roped into because of your high concept or trouble? How does the other aspect help or complicate your life?
